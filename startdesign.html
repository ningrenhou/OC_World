                        <p>Before we design the oc, many people just have an idea in their head, but there is no actual concept, this time we need to enrich their own idea. we can search for the oc in many software or website, to see how other people's oc are designed. My screenshot of this image is from Pinterest, there are a lot of artists on this website who put their own oc design, after looking at other people's oc you will have more practical content for your own ideas.</p>
