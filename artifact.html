            <p>Finally the last step! On this page I'm going to introduce a few good programs to help you create oc, both those that help with design and those that draw directly, all of which I recommend after having used them. These programs are simple and easy to use, and I think they are the best programs to help creators create oc's with.</p>

                <h1>Picrew</h1>
                <p>Picrew is a software from Japan that is a program that allows users to create as many characters as they want. There are a lot of different drawing styles to choose from inside this software, and it's perfect for creating oc images. When you draw, you need to have a picture to refer to, and if you have a picture that is very close to your own oc, you don't have to visualize your oc while you draw. I often use this program to create oc images and then use them as a reference, which is a great help for beginners when drawing oc.</p>
