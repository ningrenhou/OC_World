            <h1>OC Personalities</h1>
            <p>OC Personalities is designed to help creators be able to deeply understand and master the personality and characteristics of the oc they are designing. The character's personality traits and worldview are an important part of the creator's design of the oc. The character's personality establishes what kind of person they are and what role they play in the overall worldview. The worldview is useful in being able to help the creator connect the worldview to the character. My suggestion is to create the worldview first, so that with the help of the worldview you can better create characters that fit the worldview. This way, when someone recognizes and learns about the character in the future, the combination of the worldview and the story line can better help people to recognize the character, and a good character can be an important help in the overall story line. On this page I've shared two forms specifically designed to help creators create vivid characters and original worldviews.</p>

        <div class="forms-background">
            <div class="forms-text">
                <h1>Character Introduction Template</h1>
                <p>The form is a character design form, and this is one I found online, one of the best ones to use in my personal opinion, and the link is here: https://ca.pinterest.com/pin/1337074887179412/. This form covers the character's personal information, personality, psychology, and social relationships, and I find it to be very comprehensive and I really enjoy using it. By designing the character's information through the form, a character will appear three-dimensional and no longer be a villain with just some information, and after that, you can just put the drawn ooc picture inside the form, and a character profile will be born.</p>

        <div class="forms-world-text">
            <h1>World Framework Backstory Tectonics</h1>
            <p>This is the Worldview Basic Information Form, a form of my own creation. I created this form after some of the content that must be present to shape the worldview, this form is a bit small, my suggestion is to find a separate document to write the content based on the information mentioned on the form. You can record some important information about the worldview in the form first, and then expand on the worldview when you have time, so that you don't lose inspiration and feel like you forgot to record it, and so that you can go ahead and create characters based on some basic information.</p>
