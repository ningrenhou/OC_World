    <!--About OC-->
    <div class="title">
        <h1>About OC</h1>
        <p>Creating this site is something I've always wanted to do. It was when I saw all my friends around me designing oc's that I took the plunge. A lot of the anime and manga I've read, I felt like a lot of the authors didn't genuinely like their own characters, and it made me feel angry, and I'd think that if I could design a world with a lot of characters, I'd make their lives a lot happier. And when I first started designing my own ooc, it was like I had discovered a new world and I couldn't wait to write a lot of stories about the characters and create the worldview. I would feel like I was a mother and truly wanted the characters I designed to be happy every day and not have so many worries.</p>
        <div class="title-p">
            <p>I wish more people could realize the joy and pleasure of designing ooc, whether it's creating a character or rather creating an image of yourself, it's definitely created with good hope and imagination when creating. I believe that every character is the creator's child, so I would very much discourage such shameful behavior as plagiarism. Having one's ooc plagiarized is like having a child abducted. I hope everyone can have the patience to read this and be able to say that after reading it stick to the heart of originality and you will be successful in whatever you do at that time!</p>
